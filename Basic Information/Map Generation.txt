One Square = One Mile by One Mile
One Block = Five Squares by Five Squares
One Chunk = Any number of same terrain type blocks that are directly interconnected
The Center Square of each block defines the block type
Blocks will always be more than half their type
Each Block has one guaranteed special Square
Each Block can have up to two additional special Squares
	25% chance to gen each
Only one tribe can spawn per Block
	Probably give each block a special spawn Square that is not one of the special Squares
A chance that blocks bordering each other can have terrain bleed
	I'm thinking 8% chance per bordering square
		Still not sure how that would work, but it should make the terrain seem more natural than just five by five chuncks of terrain
A certain number of Blocks of the same terrain type must connect to one another to count as a valid terrain
	At least for the first of the basic terrains
	Special terrains are ALWAYS exempt from this rule
	If at least one set of the basic terrains are generated to this rules specifications then it no longer matters for other terrain
	The number will be dependant on map size
		Three for a small map
		Four for a medium map
		Five for a large map
		Six for a giant map
The map WILL be bordered by oceans, except one side, that will be tundra instead of ocean
	One side of the map will be three squares wide
		Islands will be allowed to spawn on this side
		This side will not be on the same side as the Tundra
All squares bordering the ocean will be Coastal terrain
	The only exceptions to this will be the Island and Tundra terrains
	All terrain types will have the standard terrain bleed chance
		This terrain bleed will take place before the conversion to Coastal terrain
Map Generation order of operations:
	1 - Randomly select a number from 0 to 3 to determine the side that the Tundra will be generated on
		A - 0 is north
		B - 1 is east
		C - 2 is south
		D - 3 is west
	2 - Randomly select a number from 0 to 3 to determine the side that the Islands will be generated on
		A - 0 is north
		B - 1 is east
		C - 2 is south
		D - 3 is west
		E - If the number is the same as the number for the Tundra it will select another number
	3 - Fill in the borders of the map with the appropriate terrain
	4 - Begin the process of placing Blocks
	5 - Place Island Blocks in Ocean squares
	6 - Begin terrain bleeding
	7 - Generate Coastal Squares
		A - There should be a small chance that the coastal square does not convert the terrain, to simulate an oceanic cliff(such as the White Cliffs of Dover)
	8 - Place Special Terrain Elements
		A - Volcanos, Land Cracks, etc...
	9 - Generate Special Terrain Squares
		A - Remember to set it to have a single guarranteed Special Terrain and UP TO 2 more Special Terrain Square
		B - These random Special Terrain Squares do not count Special Terrain Elements, witch always count as a Special Terrain Square
	10 - Determine a random Square for tribal spawning
	11 - Place the Player Tribe
	12 - Place NPC Tribes
	13 - Generate Unique Creatures
		A - One per Chunk
	14 - Place Unique Creatures
		B - One per Chunk
